The 3D Studio to Deus Ex mesh converter ("3ds2de") is a modification of the "3ds2unr" utility, originally written to convert 3D Studio models (meshes) into the Unreal format.  3ds2de will do the same, but for the Deus Ex format.

For instructions, see the included ImportingModels.html document.

See http://www.planetdeusex.com/tack/3ds2de/3ds2de.html for updates and more information.
